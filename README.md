# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World!   
**Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm thrilled to have you here. I'm Lana, a 2nd-year student pursuing Computer Science and Informatics at UC Irvine.**

## âœ¨ About Me 
I love both computer science and design, but what truly intrigues me are the points where these two fields intersect. I'm a strong believer in making products that are both intuitive and functional.
